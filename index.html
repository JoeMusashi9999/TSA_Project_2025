    <p>We bring these values to life through our food and hospitality. As a family-owned restaurant, we warmly welcome you to a dining experience that feels like home, where every dish is crafted with care. With a diverse menu that honors many dietary needs—from Paleo to vegan—we celebrate food’s ability to bring people together. Here, everyone can enjoy a meal that meets their needs, made with the love and warmth of our family kitchen."</p>

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>At Hearth & Home, we believe dining out should be a joy for everyone—regardless of dietary preferences or restrictions. Too often, restaurants focus on catering to the majority, leaving those with specific diets to choose between a lonely salad or a side dish. Not here! We’re proud to offer a diverse menu that embraces everyone’s unique dietary needs without compromising on flavor, creativity, or variety.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Paleo Diet:</strong> For those who love eating like our ancestors, we serve dishes packed with lean meats, fresh seafood, vibrant veggies, and nutty goodness—no grains, legumes, or dairy in sight. Think grass-fed steak with roasted seasonal vegetables or grilled salmon with a zesty citrus glaze.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Pescatarian Diet:</strong> Seafood lovers rejoice! We offer a wide range of dishes featuring fresh, sustainably-sourced fish and seafood. Pair that with a selection of dairy- and egg-inclusive side dishes, and you’ll have a meal as vibrant and varied as the sea.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Vegetarian Diet:</strong> We know vegetarians deserve more than just sides. Whether you’re a lacto-vegetarian who loves creamy dishes, an ovo-vegetarian looking for hearty, egg-based options, or a lacto-ovo vegetarian who wants the best of both worlds, we’ve got creative, flavorful plates made just for you.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Vegan Diet:</strong> Our plant-based offerings are crafted to delight, featuring innovative, 100% vegan dishes that are as satisfying as they are animal-product-free. Think smoky jackfruit tacos, rich coconut curries, or hearty grain bowls loaded with fresh veggies and house-made sauces.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Keto Diet:</strong> Low-carb doesn’t have to mean low-flavor. From rich, cheesy casseroles to protein-packed entrees and veggie-forward sides, we make sure our keto-friendly dishes are indulgent and satisfying while keeping you on track.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Whether you’re Paleo, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan, keto, or simply curious, we’ve created a space where everyone can enjoy a delicious meal that suits their lifestyle. With us, no one leaves hungry—or feeling left out. Welcome to a restaurant that truly serves everyone!</p>
